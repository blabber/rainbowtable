rainbowtable
============

rainbowtable is a simple 5x5 RGB LED matrix, displaying a constant color cycle.
The circuit is fairly simple, as is the code of the firmware. This makes it easy
to understand what is going on.

Caveat
------

This project is not finished yet and therefore not fully documented.
